# 1.28 inch 240*240 ESP32C3 Round Display with Rotary Knob from VIEWE company, model UEDX24240013-MD50E

This display is available on Aliexpress for less then $25, it has a round IPS display with 240x240 resolution, display driver GC9A01A with LVGL support, PWM-controllable backlight and aluminium rotary knob with push button. 

The display should be powered with 5V and controlled by a 10-pin FFC flat cable but ships with a development breakout board wich has a micro-USB socket and holes for external power and different pin connectors onboard. 

This dev board seems to be unified for different display types and has two sockets for FFC cables and provides some additional pins which are not actually present in this specific display. But easy access to GND, 5V power and 3 unused GPIO pins (GPIO03 ADC, GPIO20 RX and GPIO21 TX) is very handy.

The build and material quality are really high, it looks really nice and the knob has very pleasant tactile feedback. The display is really bright and has wide view angles. This product has no touch screen, but for such a compact size it is actually not required.
